## Plant Disease Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks

# Overview
This project aims to develop an ML model from scratch with and without existing Ml libraries (Keras) capable of detecting and categorizing plant diseases using images of plant leaves. The system leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze leaf images and accurately classify them into different disease categories. By providing farmers with a tool to quickly identify diseased plants, this project aims to assist in early disease detection and mitigate crop damage. 

# Dataset
The dataset can be found here in this link. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease 

# Usage
To use the plant disease detection system:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies. 
Run the application using python app.py. 
Upload an image of a plant leaf to the interface.
Receive classification results indicating the detected disease.
